# 🛰️ Polkadot Parachain Observatory (PPO)

A real-time cross-chain monitoring and debugging platform purpose-built for the Polkadot ecosystem.

PPO empowers parachain developers, infrastructure providers, and cross-chain dApp builders with deep observability into runtime states, XCM message flows, and ecosystem-wide health — all from a single interface.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 🧠 Runtime State Intelligence
- Live visualization of parachain runtime state
- Pallet-level metrics: block time, event logs, storage mutations
- Interactive dependency graphs (coming soon)

### 🔗 Cross-Chain XCM Tracing
- End-to-end message flow tracking across parachains
- Hop-by-hop execution details and error points
- Visual trace map with latency and status info

### 📈 Ecosystem Health Dashboard
- Live stats on parachain activity and performance
- Cross-chain heatmaps and network insights
- Alert feed for anomalies and bottlenecks

### 🧰 Developer SDK
- Lightweight Rust SDK for custom telemetry from pallets
- Easy integration into existing Substrate runtimes
- Emits state diffs, performance signals, and XCM metadata
